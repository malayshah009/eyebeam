    <h4 class="my-3">WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT SUNGLASSES AND EYE PROTECTION</h4>
    <p class="mb-4">Sunglasses are a popular fashion accessory for many, but these days you'll find that sunglasses can also provide 
        protection for your eyes against the sun's harmful UV rays. Read on to find out more about how to choose the best 
        sunglasses and what features make them safe for your eyes.
    </p>
    <h4 class="my-3">Why Sunglasses are Necessary</h4>
    <p>Protecting the eyes is key to a healthy life. Sunglasses are necessary for when it's sunny out, foggy, or if you just 
        want to be fashionable. It's important to choose the appropriate pair of glasses so that your eyes don't get irritated. 
        Anti-reflective lenses will prevent glare from blinding you and some glasses have UV protection.
    </p>
    <h4 class="my-3">How to Choose the Right Type of Sunglasses</h4>
    <p class="mb-4"> Different types of sunglasses are designed for different purposes. For example, if you want the glasses to be stylish and to 
        protect your eyes from ultraviolet rays, a wraparound pair would be a good choice. If you're looking for something that is 
        more functional, polarized lenses are better because they have a filter which blocks out a lot of light and reduces glare.
    </p>
    <h4 class="my-3">Tips for Wearing Your Sunglasses Safely</h4>
    <p>You should never leave your sunglasses behind when you're outside, because doing so could significantly reduce the amount of 
        vitamin D you're getting. And if that's not enough to convince you, consider this: it's even more important to wear 
        sunglasses when you go on a boat ride or spend time in the snow.
    </p>
    <h4 class="my-3">How to Clean Your Sunglasses</h4>
    <p class="mb-4"> You should clean your sunglasses using a microfiber cloth and a mild soap. Make sure to dry the glasses with another 
        microfiber cloth to avoid smudging the lenses. This will help keep the glasses looking good and last longer.
    </p>
    <h4 class="my-3">Different Types of Eye Protection</h4>
    <p class="mb-4"> The type of eye protection you choose will depend on the level of risk for injury to your eyes. Uncorrected eyeglasses 
        and contact lenses are not sufficient for providing adequate protection against UV radiation. If you are at high risk of 
        eye injury because of your occupation, then a shield or visor is necessary.
